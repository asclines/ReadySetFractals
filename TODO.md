#ReadySetFractals Roadmap #
---

## Work In Progress #
---
- Optimize GPU usage for single GPU
- Improved error messages and handling
- Generate mandlebrot fractals
- Multi-OS compatibility

## Under Review #

## Done #
---
- Generate julia set fractals
- Output image is a BMP image
- Image color can be B&W or RGB colors


## Future Ideas #
---
- Be able to handle Multi-GPU
- Better way to get RGB colors
- Expand coloring to a HSV model to give more options for the coloring of the fractal
- A web interface / GUI for creating and viewing the fractals
